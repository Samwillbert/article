        it’s springtime, and that means we get to see a beautiful array of
        vibrant green all around us. This annual greening is made up of all
        sorts of plants and lichens but one of the most splendid and archaic of
        this green wall is made up of Bryophyta, or mosses. Bryophyte is the
        name for nonvascular (meaning lacking channels for transporting water
        throughout the plant) and seedless plants. Today, bryophytes are
        represented by three phyla: mosses (Bryophyta), liverworts (Hepatophyta)
        and hornworts (Anthocerophyta).
      </p>

      <p>
        Bryo means moss and phyte means plant, and these plants have been here
        for a long time. The first evidence we have of bryophytes appears in
        rocks collected from Argentina that date back to between 485 and 444
        million years ago. Like most plants who have been around for a long
        time, these green marvels function a little differently from the more
        modern approach. Instead of a customary root system they have a
        root-like structure called a rhizoid, that provides anchorage to a
        substrate (rock, tree trunk, or your rooftop), but it is not a true root
        because it does not absorb water or nutrients. Instead, these rhizoids
        simply hold moss onto their perch without digging in, which means that
        those mosses on your tree or shrub are simply friends hanging out and
        not a parasite doing damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, bryophytes are nonvascular – a trait that contributes to
        their small stature. Without this internal vascular system, which larger
        plants have, mosses cannot pump water or nutrients long distances.
        Instead water and nutrient absorption occurs throughout the surface of
        their body. This feature is simple yet effective due to all the surface
        area of their body structure. Finally, instead of producing seeds,
        bryophytes rely on spores, which are more vulnerable structures that
        rely upon wind or water for distribution. Similar to the spores produced
        by ferns and fungus, they do not travel long distances – a few inches at
        most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their basic structures, these plants are architects! Their short
        stature creates habitat akin to a miniature forest providing shelter for
        tiny creatures. They help nurture barren surfaces by helping to create
        and build healthy soil while reducing erosion, thereby setting the stage
        for larger vascular plants to move in. Mosses contribute to the water
        cycle by absorbing water and slowly releasing it – like a sponge. They
        also have a superpower allowing them to be protected during the dry
        season and then quickly rehydrate when the rains return. They aid
        nutrient cycling by altering pH and absorbing carbon. They are pollution
        intolerant since they absorb directly through their thallus (body)
        without a filtration system and are therefore an indicator of local
        environmental health.

        Not to mention, these modest green beauties humbly provide the wonderful
        green backdrop that all the other flora and wildlife enjoy. Get up close
        and investigate these miniature marvels!
